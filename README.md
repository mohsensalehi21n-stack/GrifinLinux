# GrifinLinux

GrifinLinux is an open‑source operating system project built on top of **Tiny Core Linux**. Tiny Core provides a minimal, command‑line foundation — extremely lightweight yet flexible — and GrifinLinux takes this foundation further, aiming to evolve into a modern desktop system that can rival mainstream platforms like Windows and Ubuntu.

## ✨ Vision
- Transform Tiny Core’s minimal base into a **powerful yet lightweight OS**.
- Deliver a **full desktop experience** while keeping resource usage minimal.
- Ensure everything is **transparent and open‑source**, with modular downloads and reproducible builds.
- Build a system that reflects resilience, innovation, and independence.

## 🚀 Current Status
Right now, GrifinLinux boots into a **command‑line interface** inherited from Tiny Core Linux. This is the starting point. The next milestones include:
- Adding a graphical desktop environment (Xfce, LXQt, or a custom lightweight solution).
- Packaging modular installation scripts for easy setup.
- Publishing ISO images for testing and feedback.

## 🤝 Community Call
GrifinLinux is at its earliest stage. This is the perfect time for developers, designers, and open‑source enthusiasts to join and help shape the project. Contributions can include:
- Improving build scripts and automation.
- Designing themes, icons, and branding.
- Testing ISO releases and reporting issues.
- Suggesting optimizations and new features.

Together, we can transform GrifinLinux from a Tiny Core command‑line base into a **lightweight, powerful, and community‑driven operating system**.
